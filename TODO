1. Model Mhome -> check stock price (?): get sub-price from database. Table: tr_product
2. view include/footer -> handle sub-price. if sub-price not null: regular price (price) dicoret, display sub-price.
3. Set sub-price as regular price (cart should use sub-price if sub-price exists)

For testing:
1. Go to brands -> aireloome -> imperial heritage
2. Pick cengkareng (DKI Jakarta -> Jakarta Barat -> Cengkareng)
3. Edit sub-price: super admin -> products -> imperial heritage [i] -> edit product
